#' A 'usethis'-esque Package for Base R Versions of 'tidyverse' Code
#'
#' The 'tidyverse' is awesome, but can take a bit to compile on systems
#' where there are no pre-built binary packages. Methods are provided which use
#' the facilities of the 'usethis' package to snap-in base versions of useful
#' 'tidyverse' functions that are mostly equivalent (some are more complete
#' than others). The base R counterpart functions will likely be slower than
#' the 'tidyverse' equivalents but using them will decrease 'Imports'
#' dependencies.\cr\cr Use deliberately and with caution.
